1.0rc8: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0rc7
==================================================================
 * fix: subscript excess on array bounds: 
	unaddr.sun_path[UNIX_PATH_MAX-1]: fixed
 * chg: ./webdoc directory has been expunged; website is going to 
	be maintained independently from the source of `pexec`
 * fix: program directory name contains the version itself.

1.0rc7: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0rc6
==================================================================
 * fix: additional "message" responses are added to the hypervisor protocol.
 * fix: according to standards, no <memory.h> included at all.
 * fix: hypervisor mode: a possible hangup is fixed in the main 
	hypervisor server loop (if the loadavg feature is used 
	to limit the maximum processes, past versions would 
	results pexec clients to hang in some cases).
 * fix: unix domain socket binding (in remote_control_port_bind())
	fails if the socket file exists.
 * fix: immediate close() of hypervisor client socket -- after sending
	the ``close'' command -- under some weird circumstances may 
	have caused an EPIPE on server side and therefore an abnormal 
	server termination. This has been fixed by waiting for 
	read availability right after sending the ``close'' command,
	involving the select()-based function fdwait().
 * new: FIFO and LIFO queue processing in the hypervisor mode. The previous
	versions supported only the FIFO model. The new default queue
	processing from now is LIFO.
 * fix: signals raised by EPIPEs are ignored.
 * fix: hypervisor mode: small fix in the scheduling algorithm.
 * chg: `help2man`-compatible long help is generated by the `longhelp` 
	library.

1.0rc6: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0rc5
==================================================================
 * fix: fixes in the documentation (nodes, menus, copyright issues)
 * fix: some minor improvements in the documentation
 * fix: safe malloc, realloc and strdup calls throughout the code

1.0rc5: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0rc4
==================================================================
 * chg: man page is generated from --long-help, detailed description
	is available as a Texinfo manual. This feature requires the
	`help2man` utility (http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/).
	This utility is also available as a debian package.
 * new: documentation is available under GFDL (see ./doc/COPYING.gfdl)

1.0rc4: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0rc3
==================================================================
 * new: ./configure support (autoconf)
 * chg: ./man directory renamed to ./doc
 * chg: ./html directory renamed to ./webdoc
 * new: texinfo documentation (./doc/pexec.texi)

1.0rc3: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0rc2
==================================================================
 * new: hypervisor mode, `-H|--hypervisor` + all related functionalty
 * new: additional section in the manual discussing the hypervisor mode
 * fix: some minor fixes in the hprintf() and get_number_of_cpus()
 * chg: the command line option -d|--daemon has been changed to -T|--tunnel
	(this switch this is used only internally when executing
	pexec daemons via a remote shell, i.e. this change would not
	affect the end-user interfaces; however the same version of pexec
	must be installed on both sides)
 * new: `make deb` creates a debian package on the current architecture
	(this feature requies the `dpkg-deb` utility)

1.0rc2: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0rc1
==================================================================
 * fix: missing options from -h|--help
 * new: new option `-E|--pexec-connection-variable` added
 * fix: code fixed under Solaris and Mac OSX operationg systems

==================================================================
 * new: support for direct execution on remote hosts

1.0rc0: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0pre2
===================================================================
 * fix: mutex algorithm bugs
 * fix: closing unused fd's after some fork()s
 * new: complete remote control user interface
 * new: dump/save files using remote control and mutexes
 * new: atomic execution of commands (and scripts) using remote control and
	mutexes

1.0pre2: new features, changes and fixes since pexec version 1.0pre1
====================================================================
 * fix: some minor fixes in format.c
 * fix: code cleanup in some modules (linebuffer.[ch]: separate libraries)
 * new: mutex backends
 * new: remote control user interface
