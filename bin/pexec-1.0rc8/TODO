PEXEC - List of things to be done.  Plans, ideas, whatsoever.
*************************************************************

Main code
=========

Stuff related to single-host invocation:
 - handle signals carefully, esp. SIGINT and SIGTERM
 - poll the status with some signal (SIGUSR1, i.e. like for `dd`)

Stuff related to invocation on multiple hosts:
 - check the termination of the child remote shells
 - stop all the children if some signal (SIGINT) has been received, incl.
   the sending of an appropriate command to the daemons for an explicit stop
 - remote and local files (--local-files): careful implementation

Stuff related to hypervisor mode:
 - what should happen is the hypervisor disconnects?
 - some info about the current jobs/tasks (in ``machine readable'' form):
	* name and/or submitter of the job
	* start timestamp
	* total number of tasks to be done
	* number of tasks which are done
	* current timestamp
   the same kind of info about the finalized jobs:
	* name and/or submitter of the job
	* start & finish timestamp
	* total number of tasks to be done

Generic:
 - IPv6 support
