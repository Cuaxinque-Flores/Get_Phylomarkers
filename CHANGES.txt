	     - compute_MJRC_tree() fix to contend with possible Bug in IQ-TREE v1.6.2 and v1.6.3
	       IQT v1.6.2 and v1.6.3, but not v1.6.1!, cannot compute the mjrc tree from the debug set,
	       claiming that the number of taxa are different across trees when running with FT ???
	       There is not problem with the IQ-TREE run on the same sequences...

        * added statically compiled bc for linux (Thanks to Alfredo J. Herandez @CCG_UNAM) to avoid problmes in docker containers that don't find the 
	   interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 in dynamically compiled binaries
	* added new function compute_MJRC_tree() based on iqtree -con, which computes the MJRC trees for all non-recomb input trees and top markers, for -F A|I and -t DNA|PROT
	* updated run_get_phylomarkers_pipeline.sh to 'v2.1.0_2Feb18', which calls compute_MJRC_tree() and performs proper cleanup/tidying of directories when -R 2

             - from phylip v3.69: consense pars seqboot; and from newick_utilities: nw_reroot nw_support    
	 * This makes the GET_PHYLOMARKERS v2.0.1 suite complete, as described in the manuscript submitted to 
	       Front. Microbiol. on Jan 15th, 2018

v2.0.1_22Jan18: * Fixed a parsing problem introduced due to changing file globings like *.fasta for ./*fasta
                * extended the lists of models checked by check_IQT_DNA_models and check_IQT_PROT_models to match those currently

v2.0_22Jan18: # >>> MAJOR UPGRADE: uses iqtree v1.6.1 as default search algorithm throughout the pipeline <<< 
              * now uses IQ-TREE (v1.6.1; Dec. 28th, 2017 release) as the default algorithm, both for gene- and species-tree searches!
              * Based on the benchmark results presented in the GET_PHYLOMARKERS paper, model-selection is enabled by default
	        during gene tree searches, making use of the -fast flag. The number of models evaluated (hard-coded) depends on -T 
	      * moved most functions to file lib/get_phylomarkers_fun_lib
              * added new key functions: estimate_FT_gene_trees, compute_FT_gene_tree_stats estimate_IQT_gene_trees compute_IQT_gene_tree_stats

                 * moved changes.txt to CHANGES.txt and formated the file consistently for better readability

v1.9.12_19Jan18: * changed -K 1 to -K (flag) to run mol-clock; replaced echo for msg within functions; 
                 * changed all file globings like *.fasta for ./*fasta ... so names with dashes won't become options

v1.9.11_17Jan18: * added -slow to FastTree with -T high (supermatrix); added msg function to cleanup code; updated citation message at end;
                 * moved changes messages from top of script to this file

v1.9.10.1_1Jan18: # >>> MAJOR UPGRADE: this is the version using iqtree v1.6.1 with the -fast flag 
                         on which some of the benchmark analyses reported in the paper were based on <<<
	          * changed iqtree-omp v1.5.6 to iqtreev.1.6.1 (first released on Dec 26th, 2017; fixed bug thanks to our report on Dec. 28th, 2017); 
		  * added -fast flag to the model selection calls of IQ-TREE!!!
                  * added functions check_IQT_DNA_models() check_IQT_PROT_models() to check -S strings passed by user to IQ-TREE
   	          * grep '^Gamma20LogLk' instead of ML_Lengths2 also for protein data
   	          * Changed spr_length=8 to  spr_length=10 to match the default value of FastTree 2.1.10

v 1.9.9.2_31Dic17: * grep '^Gamma20LogLk' instead of ML_Lengths2 to print the FastTree lnL score to STDOUT

v1.9.9.1_23Dic17: renamed the iqtree binary to iqtree-omp to be explicit about the multicore version

v1.9.9.0_22Dic17: aded IQ-tree searching option for the concatenated alignment, controlled with new options -A, -N and -S

v1.9.8.4_17Nov17: improved/expanded -h help message; thorough and consistent tidying of directories; cleanup of code comments

v1.9.7.1_14Nov17: added strain composition check on f?aed files to make sure each one contains a single instance for the same number of strains
		 This is a critical check to avoid problems with inparalogues in some fastas if get_homologues.pl was run with -t X and without -e.
	         Trees could be mislabeled in that case, and some alignments will most likely contain a different strain composition, 
	         generating a chimaeric concatenated file; A useful ERROR message is printed (run compare_clusters.pl with -t NUM_GENOMES.
		 Also calls run_parallel_cmmds.pl with parallel --gnu; some code cleanup

v1.9.7_14Nov17: now using parallel instead of pexec binary, which failed in CentOS  

v1.9.6.4_12Nov17: prints total number of trees with < 1 internal branches; 
                  corrected regex so that all trees and alns with < 1 int br are removed (do not pass to downstream analyses)

v1.9.6.3_11Nov17:added -R${runmode} to dir_suffix

v1.9.6.2_11Nov17: all DEBUG|VERBOSE messages written to logfile

v1.9.6_11nov17: fixed code that writes Phi-test results to Phi_results_11nov17.tsv; 
		prints the Warning: will remove file* because it has < 5 branches! to log file (no only STDOUT)

v1.9.5_8Nov17: the number of sequences in input FASTA files is checked upfront

v1.9.5_7Nov17: prints a logfile for FastTree runs and captures the lnL value of the corresponding tree; 
		more detailed info reported on alignments with too few informative sites for the Phi test to be work on

v1.9.4_6Nov17:  added error checking for Phi run when sequences lack enough polymorphism for the test to work

v1.9.3_10Oct17: improved error message when kdetrees fail

v1.9.2_1Jun17:  code cleanup > removed comments and print_development_notes(); append the $distrodir/lib/perl to PERL5LIB and export

v1.9_31May17:  improved progress messages and directory cleanup ...

v1.8.4_30May17: prepended $ditrodir/ to perl scripts that use FindBin; so that it can find the required libs in $ditrodir/lib/perl
                Added -n $n_cores flag, which is passed to run_parallel_cmmds.pl '' $n_cores, so that it runs on MacOSX!!! <<< Thanks Alfredo!
                automatically set n_cores=no_proc if [ -z $n_cores ]
v1.8.1_24May17: fixed problmes with @INC searching of rename.pl by prepending $distrodir/rename.pl

v1.8_23May17: Added R code in count_tree_branches() to use local_lib if ape is not installed systemwide; 
              searches and prints the number of available cores on HOSTNAME 
              exports R_LIBS="$R_LIBS:$distrodir/lib/R" to fix issues with library paths in R scripts
v1.7_17May17: Changed exit for Warning when pal2nal does not return a codon alignment! so that the pipeline can proceed

v1.6_15May17: added extensive debugging messages throughout the code for easier debugging; activated the -V flag

v1.5: fixed set_bindirs and check_homebinpath(), to export to PATH; 
      fully tested on a new linux account without $HOME/bin dir using freshly cloned distro; Note that R and Perl libs were already in ENV

v1.3: further refinement in set_bindirs() and check_homebinpath(), validated on yaxche; minor code cleanup

v1.2_13May17: refined the logic of set_bindirs(); added get_start_time(); improved error checking code, including get_script_PID()
              fixed a bug in -t PROT 

v1.1_13May17: Major update to facilitate installation by users: added set_pipeline_environment(), check_homebinpath(), set_bindirs(), 
	      which ckeck and setup the ENVIRONMENT for the pipeline. Added new bin/ and pop_gen_tables/ dirs for consistency. 
	      The bin/linux dir contains the 2cnd party binaries compiled for 64bit linux machines. Need to compile for darwin

v1.0_11May17: git commited; first version on GitHub: https://github.com/vinuesa/get_phylomarkers

v0.9_10May17: important speed improvement due to running pal2nal.pl and run_parallel_molecClock_test_with_paup.sh
	      in parallel with run_parallel_cmmds.pl 

v0.8_9May17: added -R 1|2, for Phylo|popGen, based on popGen_summStats.pl and pre-computed Tajima's D and Fu-Li crit value tables
             with missing values predicted by lm() in R, based on the original critical values in Tajima's 89 and  Fu and Li 1993 papers
             The critical CI values are gathered by get_critical_TajD_values() and get_critical_FuLi_values()

v0.7_2May17: added -e min_no_ext_branches -c $codontable and -C print_codontable() for pal2nal.pl, which is now run from within a loop
   	     runs compute_suppValStas_and_RF-dist.R in the top_X_markers dir

v0.6_1May17: added get_script_PID() and count_tree_branches(); added -t BOTH
